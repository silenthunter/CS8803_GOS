Compiling:
run 'make'

Running the Server:
./http_server <port> <queueSize> <worker threads>

Running the Proxy:
./http_proxy <port> <remote port> <queueSize> <worker threads>

*note: remote port is only used when using simple request from Telnet. Otherwise the proxy settings from the http_client or Firefox will replace it.*

Example---------------------------------------
>telnet 127.0.0.1 8000
GET test.txt Http/1.0

HTTP/1.0 200 OK

this is a test file

Connection closed by foreign host.
----------------------------------------------

Running the Client:
./http_client <proxy address> <proxy port> <file name> <client threads> <loops per thread> [Remote host]

*File name may only be a relative path if the server is 'http_server'. Otherwise use absolute*

----------------------------
ex: ./http_client 127.0.0.1 8000 google.com/index.html 1 1 google.com
ex: ./http_client 127.0.0.1 8000 test.txt 1 1
----------------------------

This will connect to the proxy on port 8000, and sends:
GET google.com/index.html
Host: google.com

The 'Remote Host' arg can be left of for connecting to the local server
